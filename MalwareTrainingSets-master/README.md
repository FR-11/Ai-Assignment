*UPDATE*
Many people asked me about the scripts I used to generate MIST-Modified JSON. So here there are ! (take a look to scripts section).
You might use `mist_json.py`  as a reporting module from CuckooSandbox and the script `fromMongoToARFF.py` to generate ARFF files suitables for WEKA.

If you are going to create new datasets by running your local CuckooSandbox using `mist_json.py` module and you wanto to share them, please feel free to make pool requests !

If you want to know more about the working flow, please check this update: https://marcoramilli.com/2019/05/14/malware-training-sets-followup/
